Welcome to my AI Outfit Planner App.

Did you ever wake up late for your 8 am lecture, sleep deprived, picking out random clothes so you can make your lecture at the expense of you looking crazy? Yeah, me too. Well, I wanted to change that.

FIT AI stores a digital version of your closet, and generates outfits for you using AI based on certain preferences, styles, weather, and much more.

This project is created using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase + Firestore.

Full read me will be created upon complete creation of the app. Thank you for your patience.
